## <span id="about">About Me</span>  
I am an MSc student in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH ZÃ¼rich, specializing in perception, computer vision and AI. My passion lies in developing autonomous mobile robots that can navigate and solve complex challenges in the real world. I have worked on robot perception and state estimation, including research in event-based vision and autonomous systems, always striving to build intelligent, adaptable robots that understand their environment and make real-time decisions.

Excited by the potential of robotics to reshape industries and human interaction, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of autonomy to create robotic systems that can operate reliably.
